This is a simple 2-D Jump-and-Run game where you play a round, yellow Blob that has to solve
riddles and must evade the attacks of corona infected evil Blobs that can fly and try to
infect you with the virus. The goal is to find the vaccine at the end of each level.

There are 10 levels with increasing difficulty you can unlock.

On a desktopbrowser use the arrow keys to move and space to jump. ESC brings you to the menu.
On a mobile Browser use the motion-sensor to move and tap the screen to jump. The menu button
is on the top left corner of the screen.

The AI enemys are controlled by a recurrent neural network that has been trained via genetic
algorithms on 3 training levels.

This repo also contains a leveleditor and local server. For more details see the documentation
pdf under /doc. The local server can just be started via the .bat file on windows, or the main.dart
under /LocalServer/bin/ and then the game can be played on "http://localhost/index.html".
